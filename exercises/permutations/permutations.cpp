/*
 * Permutations are a sequence of elements that can be rearranged in a number of ways.
 * For example, the word "hat" has 6 permutations: "hat", "hta", "aht", "ath", "tha", "tah".
 * The number of permutations of a set of n elements is n! (n factorial).
 */

/*
 * Write a definition for the function permutations that takes a vector of items of type T,
 * and returns a vector of vectors of items of type T. The returned vector should contain
 * all possible permutations of the input vector.
